## Overview
For this assignment i have created a responsive portfolio. I have created a portfolio that is individual and personalised to myself, which includes images of me, information about me as well as stock photos to hold the place of images until i am able to provide those of my own work. This website works and is reponsive on both xs screens as well as those that are larger. The content takes up the width of the xs screens and is centred on larger screens. 

## Installation
In order to use this website you can do so by opening the link in any browser on any device. The Navigation bar will collapse when on a smaller screen however the links can still be accessed through the collapsed icon as well as through the footer and through my name on the navigation bar. 
You would be able to edit or amend this by cloning through GitHub and using Visual Studio Code as the website is written using HTML and CSS.

You can find the application here:   https://oliviaowen1.github.io/My_Portfolio/index.html

## Features
I made the decision to include all of the links/buttons on the navigation bar into the collapsable list when the screen is smaller, so these are all organised and in one place. My name ("Olivia Owen") is also a button as this will take you back to the home page for quick and easy access. 
I used Bootstrap to offset the columns on the webpage as to have the content centred when on a larger screen and to ensure it fills the width and height of the screen when accessing this on a smaller device also. This also mean i could minimise the use of media queries in not having to include more custom CSS on the page.
There is however a custom CSS page linked with 3 elements being specifically altered, relating to changing the padding and margins of elements as well as background colour in order to have this fit on to different devices. If i were able to do this with Bootstrap i would have carried out the changes by using this.
As you will be able to see below, i have added three card to the homepage, in time i aim to have these hold images of my work and be able to link them to specific projects, however i understand this will come as i build my portfolio. They currently hold stock images and link to my different pages, with the first/left taking you further down the page to the 'About Me' section, the second/middle taking you to the "Portfolio" page and the last/right taking you to the Contact Me page.

Below i have written a short piece on information about me and included a photograph with a Bootstrap border.
The Portfolio page includes a carousel of stock images and a section of writing, which again be updated and expanded on with time. This was made using sub-rows in order to keep items required within one row but without having to seperate these into different rows.
The Contact Me page includes a form i have created which allows people to fill in there information, along with a question and any attachments that they may want to include.
The footer is made using the 'Jumbotron' feature and this has been designed to match the rest of the webpage, as well as include navigation links for the other pages.
Each of the HTML webpages and files were put through a HTML validator, in which each of the webpages now have no issues. The only problems that remain are those of the bootstrap elements, which i am unable to fix without changing the design of these.

I very much enjoyed creating this piece of work and look forward to continuing to improve it in the future. 


## Improvements
Should i do this project again or have chance to work on it in the future, i would like to make the buttons on the navigation of the footer match those that are the top navigation bar. I also tried to change the navigation bar to sticky, so it would stay in its position but move with the page, however i was unable to do this without it covering the content of the page and couldnt find the solution to fix this.
